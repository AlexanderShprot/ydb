# This file was generated by the build system used internally in Yandex and called "ya"
# (https://github.com/yandex/yatool).
#
# Configuration files of ya build system are usually named ya.make. If ya.make file is present
# at the root of the repository, then this repository supports ya build.
#
# If the repository supports both CMake and ya build configurations, please modify both of them.
#
# If only CMake build configuration is supported then modify only CMake files and note that only
# simple modifications are allowed like adding source-files to targets or adding simple properties
# like target_include_directories. These modifications will be ported to original ya.make files
# by maintainers. Any complex modifications which can't be easily ported back to the ya build
# system may be rejected.
