# {{ ydb-short-name }} for Database Administrators (DBA)

This section of {{ ydb-short-name }} documentation covers everything you need to know to properly manage contents of {{ ydb-short-name}} databases: [tables](../concepts/datamodel/table.md), [topics](../concepts/topic.md), and other entities.

The creation and management of databases are out of the scope of this section because in {{ ydb-short-name }} clusters these operations are either [executed by DevOps Engineers](../devops/index.md) or automated externally if you are using a managed service.
